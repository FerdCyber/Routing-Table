<title>Routing Table</title>
</head><body><b><u>ROUTING TABLE</u><br/>
<br/>
</b><b>Objective</b>: We will be viewing the routing table on routers(R1). What routes are present and why.<br/>
<br/>
In order to view the routing table we use the command &quot;show ip route&quot;<br/>
<img src="12.png"/><br/>
The router has a connected route for the 10.10.10.0/24 network and a local route for 10.10.10.1/32. They were automatically created when the IP address 10.10.10.1/24 was configured on interface gigabitethernet0/0<br/>
<br/>
We will be configuring ip address 10.10.20.1/24 on interface gigaethernet0/1.<br/>
The screenshot below demonstrates the commands and procedures required to do this configuration.<br/>
<img src="13.png"/><br/>
We used the command &quot; config t&quot; to access the configuration terminal to enter configurations commands.<br/>
I went ahead to enter &quot;interface gigabitethernet0/1&quot; to specify the NIC i am configuring. Then I entered &quot;ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0&quot; to specify the configured ip address and respective subnet for this configuration.<br/>
I checked the results of this configuration using &quot;show ip route&quot; command as shown below.<br/>
<img src="14.png"/><br/>
And as we can see in the screenshot gigabitethernet0/1 has been configured the ip address 10.10.20.0/24. This means the router has routes for both interfaces and can route traffic between hosts on the 10.10.10.0/24 and 10.10.20.0/24 networks. This means hosts on these two seperate networks can communicate through this router since they are both configured on the same router and on the same subnet.<br/>
<br/>
Now I will be configuring a static route to the ip address 10.10.30.0/24 with a next hop address of 10.10.10.2<br/>
<img src="15.png"/><br/>
So the router has routes to its locally connected networks, and also to 10.10.30.0/24 which is available through 10.10.10.2</body></html>
